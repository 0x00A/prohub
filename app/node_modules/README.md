# SYNOPSIS
Modules found here are specific to solving the problem in this application,
they would have little meaning or usefullness outside of it.

Having an inner `node_modules` directory has several benefits.

- no paths to refer to, keeps refactors easy.
- require modules of code from the client or server.
- document each feature by treating it like a module (package.json, readme.md, etc).
- easy path to factoring out code and then actually publishing it as a module.
